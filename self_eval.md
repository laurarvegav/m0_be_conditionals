# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
when we need to evaluate a variable and depending on the result of that evaluation, we need to execute diferent actions.
2. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
I would locate my git commands in the father directory, that would have saved a a lot of time.
3. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
I used logic and is rusty but hopefully will get back in track with all those amazing challenges. I got to receive feeback from Laura and Rachel and that guided me just in the right moment!
